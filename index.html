                <p>First coined in the 18th century by an English poet, <strong>Less is more</strong> would go by relatively unnoticed for nearly two centuries before finding resonance with German architect and designer Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. As a leading figure of the Modernist Movement, Mies found new meaning in the phrase, applying it to new realms and pioneering new modes of thinking for generations to come.</p>
                <p>Now a well-versed element in any design curriculum, the poignant declaration was once considered revolutionary in the 30’s and 40’s. It was then that architects first began distancing themselves from the preconceived notion that any respectable architecture should pay homage to the opulence and apparent complexity of art as a whole. Less is more turned the status quo on its head, declaring pure essentiality and functional perfection as the greatest result possible.</p>
                <p>It became the principle at the base of Mies van der Rohe’s new style of architecture, looking not to glitz, glamour, or formal complexity, but rather to the true essence of architectural construction to exalt its being.</p>
                <p>Over the course of his career, Mies van der Rohe dedicated himself not only to architecture, but also the design objects that were destined to fill the interiors of his countless projects. Among these, the Barcelona Chair, originally created for the German Pavilion of 1929, is still in production by Knoll, who bought rights to the design in 1953. Even here the principle remains the same. A polished chrome frame, inspired by the form of scissors, is met with a quilted leather cushion where 40 squares are cut and sewn by hand.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Mies van der Rohe, we’ve learned to surround ourselves with simple, sober, and essential spaces, adding substance to our lives and placing faith in quality over quantity. Today, it would seem that Less is more attitude is more important than ever — both in architecture and everyday life.</p>

                        The Barcelona Pavilion, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich, was the German Pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona, Spain. It is an important building in the history of modern architecture, known for its simple form and its spectacular use of extravagant materials, such as marble, red onyx and travertine.<br><br>
